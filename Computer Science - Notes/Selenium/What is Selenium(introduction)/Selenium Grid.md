# Birth of Selenium Grid

Selenium Grid was developed by **Patrick Lightbody** to address the need of minimizing test execution times as much as possible. He initially called the system “**Hosted QA**.” It was capable of capturing browser screenshots during significant stages, and also of **sending out Selenium commands to different machines simultaneously.**

**Features:**

-   Enables **simultaneous running of tests** in **multiple browsers and environments.**
-   **Saves time** enormously.
-   Utilizes the **hub-and-nodes** concept. The hub acts as a central source of Selenium commands to each node connected to it.
