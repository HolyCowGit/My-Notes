# Birth of WebDriver

**Simon Stewart** created WebDriver circa **2006** when browsers and web applications were becoming more powerful and more restrictive with JavaScript programs like Selenium Core. **It was the first cross-platform testing framework that could control the browser from the OS level.**

The WebDriver proves itself to be **better than both Selenium IDE and Selenium RC** in many aspects. It implements a more modern and stable approach in automating the browser’s actions. WebDriver, unlike Selenium RC, does not rely on JavaScript for Selenium Automation Testing. **It controls the browser by directly communicating with it.**

The supported languages are the same as those in Selenium RC.
