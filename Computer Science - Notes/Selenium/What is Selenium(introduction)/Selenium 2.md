# Birth of Selenium 2

In **2008**, the whole Selenium Team decided to merge WebDriver and Selenium RC to form a more powerful tool called **Selenium 2**, with **WebDriver being the core**. Currently, Selenium RC is still being developed but only in maintenance mode. Most of the Selenium Project’s efforts are now focused on Selenium 2.
