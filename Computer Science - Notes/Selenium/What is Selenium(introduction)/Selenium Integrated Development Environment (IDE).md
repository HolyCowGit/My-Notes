# Birth of Selenium IDE

**Shinya Kasatani** of Japan created **Selenium IDE**, a Firefox extension that can automate the browser through a record-and-playback feature. He came up with this idea to further increase the speed in creating test cases. He donated Selenium IDE to the Selenium Project in **2006**.
